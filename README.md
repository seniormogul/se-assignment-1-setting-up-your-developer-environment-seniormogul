# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
   WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
   DONE- VISUAL STUDIO
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
   DONE

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
DONE
5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
   DONE

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
   DONE

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.
DONE
8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.
DONE
9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

1. Visual Studio Code:

Visit the official download page: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Click the "Download for Windows" button.
Double-click the downloaded installer (.exe file).
Follow the on-screen instructions. It's generally recommended to keep the default settings during installation.
2. MySQL:

Download the MySQL Community Server installer from the official website: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/
Choose the appropriate version based on your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
Double-click the downloaded installer (.msi file).
Important: During installation, select the "Developer Default" configuration. This ensures the necessary components for Python development are included.
Follow the on-screen instructions, paying close attention to the following steps:
Set a strong root password for MySQL (this is the main administrative account).
Choose the port number for the MySQL server (the default is 3306, but you can change it if needed).
Remember the root password and port number, as you'll need them to connect to MySQL from Python scripts.
3. Python:

Visit the official Python downloads page: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
Download the latest stable version suitable for your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
Double-click the downloaded installer (.exe file).
Important: During installation, make sure to check the option "Add Python 3.x to PATH" (where "x" is the major version number). This allows you to run Python commands from any directory in your command prompt or terminal.
You can leave the other options at their default settings.
Follow the remaining on-screen instructions.
4. Git:

Visit the official Git downloads page: https://www.git-scm.com/downloads
Download the latest version for Windows.
Double-click the downloaded installer (.exe file).
Follow the on-screen instructions. It's generally recommended to keep the default settings during Git's installation.
Verification:

Visual Studio Code: Open VS Code. You should see the welcome screen or an empty workspace.
MySQL: Open a command prompt or terminal window. Type mysql -u root -p (replace -p with your root password if you set one during installation). If prompted for a password, enter the root password. If the connection is successful, you'll see the MySQL prompt.
Python: Open a command prompt or terminal window. Type python --version or python3 --version (depending on the downloaded version). You should see the Python version number displayed.
Git: Open a command prompt or terminal window. Type git --version. You should see the Git version number displayed.

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
